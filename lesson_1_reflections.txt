What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   pros are that whenever programmer feels to commit it can be done or somethimes
   it could be large commit or it could be too small and the cons is confusing
   when to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because for example adding some feature may changes multiple files nad commit
    them toghether later we could easyli see that feature and modify it.

could break something?

    the commits
