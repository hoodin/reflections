Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    because maybe i don't know when i'finished with my work and if it's pull
    automatically maybe some files are wrong and i have to fetch them and again
    pull the that make it hard!

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork means get copy of a repository to my gihub account and clone means to get
    a repository to my local computer nad branch means to when we don't wanna
    conflict the master files and try something new we make a branch and work
    on it and if it works we merge it with master brwnch and push it.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    well if we make some changes and doesn't work we can fix it fast and work
    on it all offline and if it's work we push it
